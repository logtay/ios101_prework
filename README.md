**App Idea**\
I am interested in building an app with pet owners in mind, specifically dogs and cats. The main feature of the app would be to allow users to look up whether certain items were safe for their pet (for example, chocolate being toxic to dogs and lilies being toxic to cats). They would also be able to save information about their pet, such as the food brand and type they are currently eating, their medication dosage amounts and schedule, and keep track of any notes of changing behavior. I am a dog and cat owner and often find myself looking up these things or making notes either on paper or in my phone that I later potentially forget about or lose. It would be helpful for pet owners to have this information all in one place, to easily reference and to receive information relevant to their individual pet. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
